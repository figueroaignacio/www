## AI Assistant

This portfolio includes a fully integrated AI assistant to help visitors explore my content in an interactive way.

### Powered by FastAPI and Groq, AI Assistant provides:

- Answers about me, my background, and my work
- Help navigating the website
- Insights about the technologies I use
- Discussions and summaries of my blog posts
- Context-aware guidance about my projects and stack

### AI Assistant shows how real-world AI features can be integrated into a modern UI using:

- Next.js App Router
- Groq models
- Framer Motion animations
- Clean, minimal UI with Tailwind

It is part personal assistant, part tech demo, and a fun nod to my name:
