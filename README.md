# Ignacio Figueroa — Personal Portfolio

## A modern, fast, and fully custom portfolio built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Payload CMS, and PostgreSQL.

It showcases my work, articles, projects, and includes an AI-powered assistant named N.A.I (Nacho Artificial Intelligence) to help visitors explore my content in an interactive way.

This portfolio reflects my focus on clean UI, high performance, accessibility, and a great developer experience.

## N-bot — Nacho's portfolio assistant

### Powered by the Groq SDK, N-bot provides:

- Answers about me, my background, and my work
- Help navigating the website
- Insights about the technologies I use
- Discussions and summaries of my blog posts
